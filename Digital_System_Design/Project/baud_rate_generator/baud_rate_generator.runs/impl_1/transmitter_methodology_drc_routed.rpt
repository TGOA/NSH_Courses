LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell shiftting/Q[0]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) delayedWhatever_reg/CLR, fsm/FSM_sequential_current_state_reg[0]/CLR, fsm/FSM_sequential_current_state_reg[1]/CLR, counter1/counter_reg[0]/CLR, counter1/counter_reg[1]/CLR, counter1/counter_reg[2]/CLR, flip/q_reg/CLR, shiftting/Q_reg[0]/CLR, shiftting/Q_reg[1]/CLR, shiftting/Q_reg[2]/CLR, shiftting/Q_reg[3]/CLR, shiftting/Q_reg[4]/CLR, shiftting/Q_reg[5]/CLR, shiftting/Q_reg[6]/CLR, shiftting/Q_reg[7]/CLR (the first 15 of 15 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
